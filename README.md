# Assignment 1: Symbolic Planning

In this assignment, you will use PDDL to formally define domains and problem descriptions for a planner. The goal of this exercise is to build familiarity with precise planning domain descriptions. There are three parts to this assignment, and each part will require you to create a domain definition file and a problem definition file for a total of six files (three domain definition files and three problem definition files).

**Important**: We will only work with the STRIPS subset of the PDDL 1.2 specifications for this assignment. The only requirement your PDDL files should include is `(:requirements :strips)` .

## Part 1: Getting started

For this assignment, you will use the [FastDownward](https://www.fast-downward.org/) planning system to design and test planning domains and problems. Note: version >= 23.06 compiles using the C++20 standard. The autograder runs version 22.12.

To get the planner and compile it:  If you run into issues, 

1. Install dependencies as listed in the [FastDownard build instructions](https://github.com/aibasel/downward/blob/main/BUILD.md).
   - **Windows users**:  Make sure to install the [Visual Studio Build Tools Supporting C++](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe). These are also contained in the "Desktop development with C++" workload that you can download via the Visual Studio Installer. You may also need to create a new, empty C++ project for the libraries to register.
3. Clone the code for fast-downward:
   ``` 
    git clone <https://github.com/aibasel/downward.git>  
    cd downward
    git checkout origin/release-22.12
   ```
4. Compile using the provided build script:  
    ```
    ./build.py
    ```
    - **Windows users**:  See the FastDownward build instructions above.

To run the planner and check the results:

1. Run the planner with a planner configuration (lama-first used here)  
    ```
    ./fast-downward.py --alias lama-first {domain-file.pddl} {problem-file.pddl}
    ``` 
   For example:
   ``` 
    ./fast-downward.py --alias lama-first cake-domain.pddl cake-problem.pddl
   ```
2. If a plan is found, it will be saved in the file sas_plan by default. You can inspect the plan in the file:  
    `cat sas_plan`

## Part 1: Complex Eat-Cake

You have been provided a `cake-domain.pddl` and `cake-problem.pddl` for the `have-cake-eat-cake` problem discussed in class. Modify the domain and the problem to create a more complex setting:

1. Create file, `cake-complex-domain.pddl` with conntent from `cake-domain.pddl`. Keep `cake` as domain name. Modify the domain in `cake-complex-domain.pddl` so that once something is baked, the dishes are dirty, and need to be cleaned using the "clean" action. The resulting plan in the simple eat-cake-have-cake problem but using this complex domain should be:  
    ```
    (bake cake)  
    (eat cake)  
    (clean )  
    (bake cake)
    ```  
    **What to turn in**: `cake-complex-domain.pddl` , which should be compatible with the original provided cake-problem.pddl .  

2. Create file, `cake-complex-problem.pddl` with content from `cake-problem.pddl`. Expand the problem in `cake-complex-domain.pddl` to satisfy the additional objects pie and cookies, and to have a goal condition that includes eaten pie and eaten cookies.  
    The initial state must be empty.  
    The goal condition must be: `(and (eaten cake) (eaten pie) (eaten cookies)) `

    **What to turn in**: `cake-complex-problem.pddl`, which should be compatible with the original provided cake-domain.pddl .


## Part 2: Single-Piece King Moves

1. Create a PDDL domain definition, `king` in file `single-king-domain.pddl`, for a single king chess piece moving on an arbitrary sized board. You must use the following predicates, _and no others_:
- `(at ?p ?x ?y) `- Indicates that piece ?p is at the square ?x, ?y
- `(adjacent ?y1 ?y2)` - Indicates that the x- or y- coordinates ?y1, ?y2 are adjacent
- `(occupied ?x ?y)` - Indicates that the square ?x, ?y is occupied by another (untitled) piece
The domain definition must define a move action with the following signature:
  ```
  (:action move
        :parameters (?p ?x1 ?y1 ?x2 ?y2)
  ```
    > :warning: The domain name must be named exactly `king` to pass Autograder checks.

2. Create a compatible PDDL problem definition, `single-king-problem` in file `single-king-problem.pddl`, for an 8x7 (8 squares along y direction, and 7 along x direction) board, with the following initial state:
- The king starts out from the lower left corner of the board (1, 1).
- Mark the coordinates (7,7) and (6,7) as occupied.

The final condition should be for the king to reach (7, 8)
Your objects section must contain only the following:
```
(:objects
    king
    x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7
    y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 y8
)
```
The domain definition must be precise enough to ensure that all valid moves are permissible and that all invalid moves are disallowed - we will test your domain definition for correctness.

**What to turn in**: The file `single-king-domain.pddl` , which defines the king's move, and the file `single-king-problem.pddl` that defines the above problem.


## Part 3: Single-Piece Knight Moves

Create a PDDL domain definition, `knight` in file `single-knight-domain.pddl`, for a single knight chess piece moving on an arbitrary sized board. You must use the following predicates, and _and no others_:

- `(at ?p ?x ?y)` - Indicates that piece ?p is at the square ?x, ?y
- `occupied ?x ?y)` - Indicates that the square ?x, ?y is occupied by another (untitled) piece
- `(delta1 ?y1 ?y2)`- Indicates that the x- or y- coordinates ?y1, ?y2 are adjacent
- `(delta2 ?y1 ?y2)` - Indicates that the x- or y- coordinates ?y1, ?y2 are separated by one square

The domain definition must define a move action with the following signature:
```
(:action move
    :parameters (?p ?x1 ?y1 ?x2 ?y2)
```
    > :warning: The domain name must be named exactly `knight` to pass Autograder checks.

2. Create a compatible PDDL problem definition, `single-knight-problem` in file `single-knight-problem.pddl`, for an 8x7 (8 squares along y direction, and 7 along x direction) board, with the following initial state:
- The knight starts out from the lower left corner of the board (1, 1).
- Mark the coordinates (2,3) and (6,6) as occupied.
The final condition should be for the knight to reach (7, 8)
Your objects section must contain only the following:
```
(:objects
    knight
    x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7
    y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 y8
)
```
The domain definition must be precise enough to ensure that all valid moves are permissible and that all invalid moves are disallowed - we will test your domain definition for correctness.

**What to turn in**: The file `single-knight-domain.pddl` , which defines the king's move, and the file `single-knight-problem.pddl` that defines the above problem.


## Extra Credit: Dual Knight Moves

Create a PDDL problem definition, `dual-knights-problem` in file `dual-knights-problem.pddl`, for an 8x7 (8 rows, 7 columns) board with two knight chess pieces. This problem definition must be compatible with the domain definition in part 3.
Your objects section must contain only the following:
```
(:objects
    knight1 knight2
    x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7
    y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 y8
)
```
The initial state must have:
- knight1 at (1,1)
- knight2 at (7,8)
- Mark the coordinates (2,3) and (6,6) as occupied.
The final condition should be for knight1 and knight2 to swap positions.

**What to turn in**: The file `dual-knights-problem.pddl` , which must be compatible with your `single-knight-domain.pddl` from part 3.

# Submission Instructions
Place the following files into a flat zip file (no directories) and submit in Gradescope under AI388U-assignment1:
1. `cake-complex-domain.pddl` for part 1.1
2. `cake-complex-problem.pddl` for part 2.2
3. `single-king-domain.pddl` for part 2.1
4. `single-king-problem.pddl` for part 2.2
5. `single-knight-domain.pddl` for part 3.1
6. `single-knight-problem.pddl` for part 3.2
7. `dual-knights-problem.pddl` for Extra Credit

# Debugging Tips

Gradescope tests consider cases that go beyond the simple initial conditions as described in this readme.  If you are struggling to pass some of the tests, we recommend trying out small scenarios by hand.  Issues can often be attributed to unconsidered edge cases. 

If you are continuing to fail test cases with `multi` in their name, ensure your domain names are named according to the expected names that the test cases are expecting. Check the domain setup instructions for each problem set.

**Note**: Test cases with `multi` in their name mean that they are testing multiple problem configurations. They are not testing multiple pieces, which is only considered in the `dual-knights-problem.pddl`.
